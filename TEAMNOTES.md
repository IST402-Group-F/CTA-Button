9/16/2021 - created boilerplate in class as well as group repo, set meeting time, began initial steps for shop button

9/20/2021 - met virtually for an hour, Liam worked on button states and button responsiveness to amount of text, Liz on button being a link and opening in a new tab when clicked,

9/21/2021 - Attendance - What We Learned: We need to pay more attention to the demo file, some different css tricks
                         Next Steps: Adjust button states, improve usability/reusability and make it more open-ended

9/23/2021 - In class work: Both worked on adding the simple icon library into our code and played around with putting the desired icon into our project (shopping-cart);

9/26/2021 - Liam finished implementing the icon into the button

9/28/2021 - In class activity
SIMILARITIES: hover and focus changes appearance of button, css style is similar in terms of formatting
DIFFERENCES: we have icon able to be enabled, their button does not work with tabbing
What we would ideally implement: The box shadow because we think that it is nice stylistically 
box-shadow: 0 12px 16px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24),
          0 17px 50px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
